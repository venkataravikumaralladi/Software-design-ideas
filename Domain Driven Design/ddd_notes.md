The domain is a fancy way of saying the problem you’re trying to solve. Depending on which system you’re talking about about, the domain might be online reailer,
purchasing and procurement, or product design, or logistics and delivery, industrial product, bank product etc.  Software developer spend their days trying to
improve or automate business processes physically happening in real time world in secured and safety manner ; the domain is the set of activities that those
processes support. A model is a map of a process or phenomenon that captures a useful property.
The domain model is the mental map that business owners have of their businesses. 

Effective communication is the central theme of the domain-driven design tools and practices DDD can be divided into two parts: strategic and tactical.

The strategic tools of DDD are used to analyze business domains and strategy, and to foster a shared understanding of the business between the different stakeholders.
We will also use this knowledge of the business domain to drive high-level design decisions:decomposing systems into components and defining their integration patterns.

Domain-driven design’s tactical tools address a different aspect of communication issues. DDD’s tactical patterns allow us to write code in a way that reflects
the business domain, addresses its goals, and speaks the language of the business.

Domain-driven design is even more important for software architects, and even more so for aspiring software architects. Its strategic design decision tools will 
help you decompose a large system into components—services, microservices, or subsystems—and design how the components are integrated with one another to form
a system.
