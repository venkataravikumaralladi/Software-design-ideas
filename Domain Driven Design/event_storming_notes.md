EventStorming is a low-tech activity for a group of people to brainstorm and rapidly model a business process. In a sense, EventStorming is a tactical tool for sharing business domain knowledge. An EventStorming session has a scope: the business process that the group is interested in exploring. The participants are exploring the process as a series of domain events, represented by sticky notes, over a timeline. Step by step, the model is enhanced with additional concepts—actors, commands, entities, language,  external systems, and others—until all of its elements tell the story of how the business process works.

Event storming is `collobarative technique` that developer/architect will do with business people in order to come up with a design of a system that models the structure and flow of activities within the business. Note here stories are also important i.e., do the modeling according to the business

`So you sitdown with a story and a bunch of business people and a white board and a bunch of sticky notes and you start modeling.`
