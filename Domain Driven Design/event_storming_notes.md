EventStorming is a low-tech activity for a group of people to brainstorm and rapidly model a business process. In a sense, EventStorming is a tactical tool for sharing business
domain knowledge. An EventStorming session has a scope: the business process that the group is interested in exploring. The participants are exploring the process as a series of domain
events, represented by sticky notes, over a timeline. Step by step, the model is enhanced with additional concepts—actors, commands, entities, language, 
external systems, and others—until all of its elements tell the story of how the business process works.
